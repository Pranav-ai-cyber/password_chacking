# Password Strength Checker

A simple tool to check and evaluate password strength using online testing methods.  
This project helps users create secure passwords by analyzing length, complexity, and common weaknesses.

## Features

- Tests passwords for length, use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
- Detects if passwords have leaked in data breaches
- Provides feedback on password weaknesses
- Encourages creation of strong, unique passwords

## Passwords Tested

- password123 (Very Weak: common and simple)
- India@2025 (Weak: short, some complexity)
- Mai!nG01 (Moderate complexity)
- fK!@12uLM (Strong, good complexity)
- Ru$h!4P@ssW0rd (Strong, mixed characters)
- X3!m#v9L*2wR (Strong, random and complex)
- KswjS1MX17a0-DxktdS (Very Strong, excellent length and complexity)

## How It Works

The tool evaluates password strength by checking:

- Minimum length (recommended 12+ characters)
- Use of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- Predictability and common patterns
- Leak databases for compromised passwords

## Usage

1. Enter your password into the checker.
2. Review the strength score and feedback.
3. Improve your password based on the recommendations.

## Why It Matters

Strong passwords protect against brute force, dictionary, and credential stuffing attacks.  
Using this tool can help you understand password security and create safer accounts.
